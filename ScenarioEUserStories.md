### To what extent, are you already aware of your carbon footprint?

As a commuter, I do not have a high level of awareness about my current carbon footprint


### How do you feel about your travel data being tracked?

I would not mind providing post codes to the app, it would be helpful to have encryption to keep my data safe, I am generally unsure on how I feel about travel data being tracked.

### Are you looking to reduce your carbon footprint?

"Yes, I would also like to hear what I could do to reduce it, like get told that it is better to take a train or bus, however, I may not want to be traveling for hours at a time"
