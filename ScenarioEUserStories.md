### What information would you be willing to input regularly to get an accurate carbon footprint calculation?
Integration with calendar would be nice, so the user doesn't have to specify locations all the time.  Would not prefer distance travelled as opposed to the discussed postcode system, would be a hassle.

### To what extent, are you already aware of your carbon footprint?

As a commuter, I do not have a high level of awareness about my current carbon footprint

### How do you feel about your travel data being tracked?

I would not mind providing post codes to the app, it would be helpful to have encryption to keep my data safe, I am generally unsure on how I feel about travel data being tracked.
