# Scenario E. EcoCalculator

## “The application that we will be developing will be an EcoCalculator. The application will allow the user to track their carbon footprint and give the user suggestions on how they can reduce their carbon consumption.” The target audience for this app is commuters and/or people who travel for work regularly.  (Team 4D, 2019)


### To what extent, are you already aware of your carbon footprint?

As a commuter, I do not have a high level of awareness about my current carbon footprint although I know my current habits are bad.


### How do you feel about your travel data being tracked?

I would not mind providing post codes to the app, it would be helpful to have encryption to keep my data safe, I am generally unsure on how I feel about travel data being tracked.

### Are you looking to reduce your carbon footprint?

"Yes, I would also like to hear what I could do to reduce it, like get told that it is better to take a train or bus, however, I may not want to be traveling for hours at a time"
